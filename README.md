## Why MemFuse?

Large language model applications are inherently stateless by design.
When the context window reaches its limit, previous conversations, user preferences, and critical information simply disappear.

**MemFuse** bridges this gap by providing a persistent, queryable memory layer between your LLM and storage backend, enabling AI agents to:

- **Remember** user preferences and context across sessions
- **Recall** facts and events from thousands of interactions later
- **Optimize** token usage by avoiding redundant chat history resending
- **Learn** continuously and improve performance over time

This repository contains the official server core services for seamless integration with MemFuse Client SDK. For comprehensive information about the MemFuse Client features, please visit the [MemFuse Client Python SDK](https://github.com/memfuse/memfuse-python).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

> **Note**: This repository contains the **MemFuse Core Server**. If you need to know more about the standalone Python SDK for client applications, please visit the [MemFuse Client Python SDK](https://github.com/memfuse/memfuse-python).

#### Setting Up the MemFuse Server

To set up the MemFuse server locally:

1.  Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/memfuse/memfuse.git
    cd memfuse
    ```

2.  Install dependencies and run the server using one of the following methods:

    **Using Poetry (Recommended)**

    ```bash
    poetry install
    poetry run memfuse-core
    ```

    **Using pip**

    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    python -m memfuse_core
    ```

#### Installing the Client SDK

To use MemFuse in your applications, install the Python SDK simply from PyPI

```bash
pip install memfuse
```

For detailed installation instructions, configuration options, and troubleshooting tips, see the online [Installation Guide](https://memfuse.vercel.app/docs/installation).

### Basic Usage

Here's a comprehensive example demonstrating how to use the MemFuse Python SDK with OpenAI to interact with the MemFuse server:

```python
from memfuse.llm import OpenAI
from memfuse import MemFuse
import os

memfuse_client = MemFuse(
  # api_key=os.getenv("MEMFUSE_API_KEY")
  # base_url=os.getenv("MEMFUSE_BASE_URL"),
)

memory = memfuse_client.init(
  user="alice",
  # agent="agent_default",
  # session=<randomly-generated-uuid>
)

# Initialize your LLM client with the memory scope
llm_client = OpenAI(
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),  # Your OpenAI API key
    memory=memory
)

# Make a chat completion request
response = llm_client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o", # Or any model supported by your LLM provider
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "I'm planning a trip to Mars. What is the gravity there?"}]
)

print(f"Response: {response.choices[0].message.content}")
# Example Output: Response: Mars has a gravity of about 3.721 m/s², which is about 38% of Earth's gravity.
```

### Contextual Follow-up

Now, ask a follow-up question. MemFuse will automatically recall relevant context from the previous conversation:

```python
# Ask a follow-up question. MemFuse automatically recalls relevant context.
followup_response = llm_client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What are some challenges of living on that planet?"}]
)

print(f"Follow-up: {followup_response.choices[0].message.content}")
# Example Output: Follow-up: Some challenges of living on Mars include its thin atmosphere, extreme temperatures, high radiation levels, and the lack of liquid water on the surface.
```

🔥 **That's it!** Every subsequent call under the same scope automatically stores notable facts to memory and retrieves them when relevant.
